### Why this?
My goal of this setup is to make it as simple as possible, not only to setup,
but also to use.


* Simple but effecient [LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html)

* Well documented [maps](https://neovim.io/doc/user/map.html)

* [Plugins](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html#nvim-features) to give a
  great experience

* Effecient workflow

To put things in perspective, there is a million different neovim configs. Some
of these are super fast to setup, others are rather complex looking.


### Install
So ***the time has come***, you want to install this for yourself. Great thing
i was prepared for that!

### Modular
As you can see, this way of setting up neovim, makes it super simply to
reconfigure, restructure, and extend.

### Screenshots

It's a grat hobby of mine. To make stuff look great, so without a drop of
hesitation, the first thing that came to mind when making this, was to rice the
**** out of it!

Ricing at it's finest!
